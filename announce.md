## introducing 'get fit at git' training

Are you using git, but don't feel confident at it? Are you scared of losing your work when it is ready to deliver or share? Have you actually lost it some time? Do you feel uncertain or unconfident of what you are doing? Perhaps you don't see or know what git is actually doing beneath the IDE wrapper (TFS, VS, ...)? Don't feel comfortable beyond the `git add + commit` workflow? Do you need help from your colleagues when sharing or integrating changes? Have you previously worked with other non-distributed VCSs (i.e. svn) and find it difficult to get used to the git concepts and features?

In short, you believe that the _git boosts your productivity_ statement is a myth, and instead you think it's more like the opposite.

Then ... this training is for you!

The ERNI services department presents a __git for beginners__ hands-on training.

It is a best-practices course, with little theory and lots of practice. It features tips, advices and hidden information that can only be obtained when _getting your hands dirty_.

It is designed to be presential so that participants can ask questions and receive answers and feedback. Aren't you tired of so many video calls, of not being able to stand up and reach your colleagues to ask them something? No technology replaces being next to each others.

After the training, you should be able to:

* master the fundamental git commands and processes
* don't feel scared anymore using it
* control what you are doing, and don't feel git is controlling you
* boost your productivity, minimize your frustration

You'll _get fit at git_!
