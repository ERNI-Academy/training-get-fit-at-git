# get fit at git

Yet another (?) git training for beginners.

The ERNI services department introduces a git hands-on training, with little theory and lots of practice. Designed to be presential so that participants can ask questions and receive answers and feedback.

The training does not intend to replace the dozens of awesome online tutorials available online. Instead, it is expected to provide an exciting interactive learning experience. It is designed to be a best-practices course, featuring tips, advices and hidden information that can only be obtained when _getting your hands dirty_.


## target audience

People who have already started using git but don't feel confident using it. That is, people that fall into several of these categories:

* are scared of losing their work (may have actually happened!)
* feel uncertain/unconfident of what they are doing
* don't see/know what git is actually doing beneath the IDE wrapper (TFS, VS, ...)
* don't feel comfortable beyond the simple git add/commit workflow
* need help when sharing/integrating changes (pull/fetch/merge/rebase/push...)
* have previously worked with other non-distributed VCSs (i.e. svn) and find it difficult to get used to the git concepts and features

In short, people who don't agree with the _git boosts your productivity_ statement, and instead think that it's more like the opposite.

The training will not cover complicated or advanced git commands or workflows. If you already master the basics, it may not be suited for you.


## goals

After the training, participants should be able to:

* master the fundamental git commands and processes
* don't feel scared anymore using it
* control what you are doing with git, and don't feel git is controlling you
* boost your productivity, minimize your frustration (if you have any)



# contents and structure

There are no 2 equal people in git knowledge, or 2 groups. The contents may be tailored in advance depending on the group needs, but the base consists of the following.

The training starts providing a _brief reminder_ (not a detailed description) of the basic git concepts. Ideally, participants should have read or browsed the _pro git book_ or similar materials, and have some experience with the basic git workflow (add/commit).

Afterwards, some best practices hands-on tips on how to configure the git environment will be provided. This should make the training experience and the _daily git life_ smoother and hassle-free.

After a break, the exercises begin.


## hands-on exercices

A series of basic use cases and exercises cases will be presented, that participants will have to do. Help will of course be available.

Then some more complex use cases will be presented, which depending on the time allowance may be performed at home or in another session.

Exercises will be done with a graphical UI, and also with the shell (bash) command-line, in order to be familiar with it at least for the most basic tasks.

Some of the contents may be too basic, in such case they may be skipped. Although it is recommended to ensure all the participants master the fundamental workflows.


## logistics

This training is designed to be highly practical and interactive. Therefore it is better suited with a reduced attendance and preferably presential. It is recommended (but not required) to book the training with teams that work together.

The preferred attendance should be between 4 and 9 participants, of which 1 or 2 could be remote (provided their class mates help them communicate with the group).

The training is expected to last between 2 and 3 hours, including 1 break.

Participants are of course welcome to bring their own questions ("how do I do that? / what to do when X?"). They will be asked about their experience with VCSs and expectations for the training.
